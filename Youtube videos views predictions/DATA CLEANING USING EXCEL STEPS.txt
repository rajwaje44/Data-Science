DATA CLEANING DONE IN TRAIN DATA
1. WHILE VIEWING THE SUBSCRIBER COLUMN THERE WERE OUTLIERS PRESENT BUT WHEN DATA SEEN PROPERLY AND APPLYING FILTER FROM EXCEL WE COME TO KNOW 
   THAT THERE ARE NO OUTLIERS PRESENT, THERE ARE SOME VALUES WHICHARE WRONGLY PUT INTO DATA, MENTIONING BELOW VALUES:
   1. CHANNEL TITLE(THE TONIGHT SHOW) :1576229455, THIS VALUE WAS NOT AN OUTLIER BUT MIGHT BE WRONGLY PUT IN DATA, AS CHANNEL TITLE(TONIGHT SHOW)
      HAS ACTUALLY 15769455 SUBCRIBERS (THESE CHANGES WERE MANUALLY IMPUTED IN EXCEL)
   2. SAME GOES FOR CHANNEL TITLE(TMZ) AND (BOLDLY)
2. COMMING TO CATEGORY_ID COLUMN, BLANKS WERE IMPUTED BY FIRST FILTERING BLANKS IN COLUMN AND THEN LOOKING FOR SAME CHANNEL TITLE FOR EG:
   1.IN "CATEGORY_ID" THERE IS ONE BLANK ROW IN "CHANNEL TITLE: THE INFOGRAPHIS SHOW" BUT CATEGORY ID IS ALREADY GIVEN FOR "THE INFOGRAPHICS SHOW"
     i.e "THE INFOGRAPHICS SHOW" BELONGS TO CTEGORY_ID = 10, SAME GOES FOR OTHER CATEGORY_ID, CATEGORY_ID WHICH WAS NOT IN LIST WERE 
     REPLACED BY MEDIAN.
3. IN CATEGORY_ID THERE WAS ROW "â€œ24" WHICH WAS DELETED FROM EXCEL ITSELF.
4. REST OF THE CLEANING WAS DONE IN PYTHON AND STEPS WERE COMMENTED FOR FOLLOWING STEP
5. MODEL USED TO SOLVE PROBLEM: OLS, RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR, SVR(ALSO PERFORMED HYPERTUNING),XGBOOST.
6. BEST MODEL WAS BUILT ON XGBOOST.
